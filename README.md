# module

A Clojure library providing a `module` form intended to be in the
spirit of Racket.

**DISCLAIMER**: This is a first draft by someone who...

- has been hands-on with Clojure for just a week

- doesn't necessarily appreciate how Clojure namespaces work

- doesn't know the complete story behind Racket modules

What I do know is that, so far, one of the the things I miss the most
from Racket is its modules.

For details see the doc string for `module`.
